# 🏗️ Job Postings Data Warehouse Project

This repository presents a **mini end-to-end Data Engineering pipeline**, 
simulating the ingestion, transformation, and warehousing of job postings data.
It demonstrates key components of a real-world data pipeline and is designed as a **portfolio project** to showcase core skills in data engineering.

## ✅ Highlights

- 📄 Generates realistic job posting data using Python
